# Alfresco Google Drive deployment

This project provides Docker Compose template to deploy [Google Drive](https://docs.alfresco.com/google-drive/latest/) in ACS 7.3

>> This project has been designed to test the integrations easily, deploying them in *prod* environments would require additional operations and resources.


## Google Drive

Source code is available in [https://github.com/Alfresco/googledrive](https://github.com/Alfresco/googledrive)

This module has been enabled adding following property to Alfresco Repository.

```
services:
    alfresco:
        environment:
            JAVA_OPTS : '
                -Dgoogledocs.enabled=true 
            '
```

This feature is available for Share Web application and it requires additionally a Repository addon.
